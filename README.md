# Debug Utility Tool
This is a very easy to use tool that intends to help making 
logging and console.logging rich. This tool will allow you 
to have detailed message of what is going on with your project 
while debugging.

As developers we are constantly console.logging here and there
to check what is returned, what is contained in a variable or 
to simply add tracks to know how the code is executing. 

This tool allow you to set a message and everything else is done
for you. The tool will give you the line and file the error happened
at, who called, what method was used and if any data was returned and
display it nicely.

The tool also comes with sub-functionality that will allow you to
just log to a file or just console log it nicely.
